Metrik
================

[App hosted on Heroku](https://metrik.herokuapp.com/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/askl56/Metrik.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/askl56/Metrik)

A service to monitor the analytics from an array of applications. Implemented with full test driven development and using HAML. This app will be able to track apps by using APIs, client side Javascript and more. Apps will have to be verified through Nokogiri as an additional safety feature, and the app also uses Chartkick to visualize the data of events.

You can find the Javascript files [here](https://github.com/askl56/Metrik/blob/master/public/metrik_widget.js)
